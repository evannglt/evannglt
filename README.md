# Hey, I’m Evann ⚡

I build fast, learn fast, and ship fast. I’m obsessed with new tech, clean architectures, and turning ideas into products people actually use.

## 🚀 What I do
- Build and scale systems without babysitting them  
- Learn new stacks just to push them to their limits  
- Launch side projects whenever curiosity strikes  
- Mix engineering + entrepreneurship because why the hell not  

## 🛠️ Things I’ve built
### **Tailor** — AI-powered content platform  
A video app we built to experiment with real-time recommendations, vector search, and a clean microservices architecture. It started as a tech playground and turned into a full product.

### **Meetway** — event carpooling  
Co-founder & CTO. Cloud-native, integrated, built to scale.

## ❤️ What drives me
New technologies. Building stuff end-to-end. Learning by doing.  
If it’s challenging or innovative, I’m in.

Let’s build cool things.
